# Animal Advisor
A desktop application for generating advice animals with the [Memecaptain
API](https://memecaptain.com/). In early development, use at your own peril.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:whilestevego/animal-advisor.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
cd animal-advisor && npm install
```

3. Run it with

```sh
npm start
```

## Package it

Only supports Mac OSX at the moment.

From the project root, run:

```sh
npm run package
```

## Usage

Type a famous meme expression in search box and press `enter`.
Any of following should work. Just replace de text inside `{}` with whatever you want. The application is in PRE-ALPHA. There is barely any error handling at the moment. Writing anything other than the following sentences can cause doge to spin forever. The bug is in the issues.

- `y u no {text}`
- `aliens guy {text}`
- `brace yourself {text}`
- `{text} all the {things}`
- `I don't always {something} but when I do {text}`
- `{text} too damn {something}`
- `not sure if {something} or {something else}`
- `yo dawg {text} so {text}`
- `all your {text} are belong to {text}`
- `one does not simply {text}`
- `if you {text} gonna have a bad time`
- `if {text}, {word that can start a question} {text}?`
- `{word that can start a question} the {expletive} {text}`
- `success when {text} then {text}`
- `cry when {text} then {text}`
- `bad luck when {text} then {text}`
- `scumbag {text} then {text}`
- `what if I told you {text}`
- `I hate {text}`
- `why can't {personal pronoun} {text}`
- `{text} so I got that going for me`
- `{things}, how do they work?`
- `{text}{3 x a|e|i|o|u|y}{text}`
